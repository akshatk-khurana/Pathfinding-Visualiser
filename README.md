# Pathfinding Visualiser
 A pathfinding visualiser to show BFS, DFS and A* algorithms in action.

# Usage
To run this project on:
- MacOS click on the **Pathfinding Visualiser.app** file.

The black tool-tip box on the top bar tells you what you are hovering on (path/wall/start/finish).

Once you've got a maze to test, simply click on of the three algorithm buttons, which will generate yellow squares to represent the solution and come up with a summary with how long the algorithm took and how many states it explored.

To clear the tile grid, click on the 'Reset' button and a two-option dropdown will appear, one to clear the whole grid and one that retains the maze portion and removes the solved squares.
